You are to produce a message storing application in C that enables users, if they
desire, to store altered versions of the files that they provide to the application.
The files will be stored in a specified location known by the application.
Upon accessing the application, a user should be able to input the path to a file
containing a message that they wish to store.
The application will then present the user with 4 options:
• Store the file unchanged
• Censor the file before storing
• Encrypt the file before storing
• Decrypt a stored file*
Store the file unchanged
If the user chooses to store the file unchanged, the application should read the contents
of the file and store it appropriately in the defined file system.
Censor the file before storing
If the user chooses to censor the file, the application should ask the user to enter a
comma separated list of words that should be censored from the file.
The program will implement an algorithm that redacts or censors the words provided
from the text in the file. It should then read the contents of the file, redact the words if
they appear in the input file and store the result appropriately in the defined file
system.
For example:
Given the block of text below:
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
and the redactable set of words:
the, jumps, lazy
the output text stored should be
*** quick brown fox ***** over *** **** dog
Note
- The number of stars in the redacted text must match the number of letters in
the word that has been redacted.
- Capitalization is ignored.
- Only whole words that match one of the redacted words should be redacted.
o Ignore words that are part of words e.g. jumpsuit should not be
redacted given the word jumps.
o Ignore hyphenated words and words with apostrophes.
